# Machine-Learning-Capstone-Project-2
<h4>Hi There!!!</h4>
<p>Have you wondered why you were not gettting the desired results from the diet you were consuming? I mean, they seemed to be healthy and organic. You were supposed to lose weight or visit the doctor less, right?! That's because the desired nutrients are hidding at places you may not expect. This data analysis will pinpoint the sources of nutritions your body needs and those you need to avoid. So, hop on!!</p>
<h4>What can you expect from this project??</h4>
<p>This project focuses on one fish nutrient table and one meat table from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data/nutrient-value-some-common-foods-2008.html#a11">StatsCan</a>. A data analysis would investigate the source of the healthy nutrients and the unhealthy nutrients. So consumers would be able to know what food would provide the nutritions they need and what they have to avoid in order to stay away from the doctors.</p>
<h2>Steps.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>From StatsCan website, two nutrient tables will be scraped by Jupyter notebook. They would be cleaned and transformed to the right format for analysis.</li>
  <li>A statistical analysis would be performed to understand the statistical relationship.</li>
  <li>A deep dive into the datasets to answer key questions about food sources and health. At the end, reader would know exactly where to get the healthy food they need and what unhealthy food to avoid to stay away from the hospitals.</li>
  <li>A cluster machine learning model would be applied to cluster the data in terms of the source of nutrients. Then multiple supervised classification model would be trained upon the clustered datasets, so they would classify a new food to let people know if it has the nutritions they need or the one they should to avoid. </li>
  <li>Last but not least, a new item will be presented to the chosen model for classification.</li>
</ul>
